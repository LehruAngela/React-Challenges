## Time Picker

### Requirements

Q1.
Build a timepicker component for selecting time values.
The timepicker will display times in increments of 30mins from 00:00 AM to 11:30 PM.
The component should also allow a user to enter/type in a time other than the ones displayed in the list.
For example, I should be able to type in 11:15 PM.
Example in jQuery: https://timepicker.co/

##### yarn start
